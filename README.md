- 👋 Hi, I’m @rafsamins
- 👀 I’m interested in creating bots and scripts to automate daily tasks and create modern solutions to daily problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I could offer help to and give me more exposure on how programming as a team works. 
- 📫 You can reach me at chowdhursamin@gmail.com or discord at rafsamins#9250.
